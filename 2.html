    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used 
        for describing the presentation of a document written in a 
        markup language such as HTML.
        [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        [2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
        and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        [3] This separation can improve content accessibility, 
        provide more flexibility and control in the specification 
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages 
        to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a 
        separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition 
        in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file 
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages 
        that share the file and its formatting.</p>
